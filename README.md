# RSS Depot

There are a few sites that I wish had full-text RSS feeds. They either have headline-only RSS feeds or no feeds at all so this Django app is my attempt at generating full-text RSS feeds for my own use.

It'll take a bit to add in some reasonable defaults but by storing content locally, I hope to be able to dynamically regenerate feeds as needed while minimising scraping.
